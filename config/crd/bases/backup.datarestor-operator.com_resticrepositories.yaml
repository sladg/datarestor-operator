                                    should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                                    index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
